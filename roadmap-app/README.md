# Nakvas Marina Roadmap

## Description
The application created using React, Redux and TypeScript. Remote API is a Firebase Realtime Database. I used React Hooks like as useState, useMemo, useEffect, useCallback, useRef. There is filtering and sorting for every type of data. The sorting realized with the help of a custom hook. The user can add favorite rows and update the info in API.
